Hi everyone! 

Let's have some info about my Whatsapp messages sender

First you'll have to install 2 packages;

    Pandas (use "pip install pandas" command)

    Pywhatkit (use "pip install pywhatkit" command)

You can use the script in two methods;
1. Running as script using terminal and provide 3 args (NEW)
2. Running directly from your preferred IDE using input method


Please notice that you'll be asked to provide 3 things;
1. Specific path to your Excel file containing the phone numbers.
2. Your local area code (For example; Israel's local area code is +972)
3. Your message.

Please notice the following things:
1. The numbers' column first cell must be named "numbers"
2. The numbers must contain digits only!

    For example: The number 050-1111111 will be 501111111 in the Excel file.
3. If you're trying to use Israeli numbers, please make sure every number starts w\out the first '0' 
 
That's all!

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me via LinkedIn, Mail or even Facebook


Enjoy! :)
