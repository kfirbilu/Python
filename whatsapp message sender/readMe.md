Hi everyone! 

Let's have some info about my Whatsapp messages sender

First you'll have to install 2 packages;

    Pandas (use "pip install pandas" command)

    Pywhatkit (use "pip install pywhatkit" command)

You can use the script in two methods;
1. Running as script using terminal and provide 3 args (NEW)
2. Running directly from your preferred IDE using input method


Please notice that you'll be asked to provide 3 things;
1. Specific path to your Excel file containing the phone numbers.
2. Your local area code (For example; Israel's local area code is +972)
3. Your message.

Please notice the following things:
1. The numbers' column first cell must be named "numbers"
2. The numbers must contain digits only!

    For example: The number 050-1111111 will be 501111111 in the Excel file.
3. If you're trying to use Israeli numbers, please make sure every number starts w/out the first '0' 
 
That's all!

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me via LinkedIn, Mail or even Facebook 


Enjoy! :)
